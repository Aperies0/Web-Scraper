# Security & Responsible Disclosure

Thank you for taking the time to report a security issue or suspected misuse. This repository is for educational use only; please follow the instructions below when reporting issues.

## How to report a security or abuse incident
- For **sensitive reports** (including victim IPs, logs, or PII), **do not** open a public GitHub issue. Instead, email the details to: **Aperies1412@gmail.com**.  
  - If you include logs or attachments, mark them as sensitive and provide a contact email so we can follow up.

- For **non-sensitive reports** (e.g., reproducible bug reports, feature suggestions, non-sensitive misuse reports), you may open a GitHub issue and label it `abuse`.

## What to include in a report
When emailing or opening a private report, please include:
1. Timestamp (UTC) of the event.  
2. Evidence (logs, packet captures, console output). If sensitive, send by email only.  
3. Steps to reproduce (how the scanner was run, args used, environment).  
4. Your contact information (email) so we can follow up.

## Response policy
- I will acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**.  
- For confirmed security incidents I will respond with remediation steps or mitigation guidance as soon as feasible.  
- This is a small educational project; I may not be able to provide the same level of incident response as a company, but I will take reports seriously.

## Disclosure
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure is appreciated. If you would like public credit, state that in your report.  
- Do not publish details of a confirmed vulnerability publicly before remediation unless you discuss it with me first.

## Legal note
This project is provided for educational use only. The repository owner is not responsible for misuse.
